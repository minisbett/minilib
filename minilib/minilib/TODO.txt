TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

- MeasurementConstants class containing constants for converting between different units of measurement,
  e.g. meters to feet, meters to miles, inches to centimeters, etc.

- RegexConstants class containing constants for common regular expressions such as email addresses, phone numbers, etc.


IDEAS:

- Some "Retry" attribute where you can specify attempts and invertal between attempts, e.g. [Retry(3, 1000)] and it will
  retry the method the attribute was assigned to 3 times with a 1 second interval between attempts. Potentially implement
  this as an aspect using PostSharp or to avoid the dependency on PostSharp, implement it myself instead.
